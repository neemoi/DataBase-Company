# MSU-PKL-27-2022 DATABASE

**Purpose:** The purpose of the course project is to build a relational database based on the chosen subject area.

  **Task condition:**
Build a logical database structure at the level of relationships between objects and at the level of relationships between attributes of different objects, having previously determined these relationships; confirm the correctness of the resulting structure on data instances.
      To normalize relations, it is necessary to introduce restrictions, define functional dependencies and keys; bring each relationship to the third normal form.
      Formulate the following queries and show the correctness of their processing using examples:

      a. Which of the drivers in this car transported the cargo on this date?
      b. Which companies manufacture this product, not higher than this price?
      c. Which of the account holders of this bank has loans on this date?
      d. To which warehouse address was this product delivered, by car with this number?
      e. Which of the clients (full name) received this product and by which invoice numbers? 
      f. Describe queries for creating tables, indexes, and views.
      g. Add at least two user roles.
      
**C# (Windows Forms) and MYSQL(phpMyAdmin) will be used to create graphic design and develop the Backend part of the application**

# OVERVIEW OF THE GRAPHICAL APPLICATION

A graphical application has been developed to work with the database. 
When the application is launched, an authorization window opens, in the authorization window the user enters his login details or creates an account in the system in the registration window

Depending on the role, a database window opens after registration or authorization of the user. The window for the administrator is different from the user's window 
The admin window has table tabs where you can view all the data for the selected table, add data, change data, and select certain data using the “Search” button

In the user window, the user can also view the data on the table by selecting them in the signed “Table Selection” field
